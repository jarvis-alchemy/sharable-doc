Perfect 👍 thanks for sharing the diagram and approaches. I’ll help you create a professional design document for your Terraform reusable stack. The document will:

Summarize both approaches you shared (cloud-run + load-balancer only vs. cloud-run + service-account + VPC + load-balancer).

Explain pros/cons of each.

Recommend a reusable pattern.

Provide folder structure, module design, and usage guidelines.

Here’s a first draft:

📘 Terraform Reusable Stack Design Document
1. 🎯 Objective

The goal of this document is to define a reusable Terraform stack pattern for deploying applications on Google Cloud using Cloud Run, Load Balancer, Service Accounts, and VPCs. The design ensures:

Reusability across environments (dev, stage, prod).

Separation of concerns via modular stacks.

Standardization for teams/projects.

Extensibility for future integrations (monitoring, secrets, etc.).

2. 🏗️ Approaches
Approach 1 – Minimal Stack

Modules:

Cloud Run stack

Load Balancer stack

Flow:

Cloud Run → Load Balancer


Folder Structure:

appenabl/
├── modules/
│   ├── terraform-google-stack-cloud-run/
│   └── terraform-google-stack-loadbalancer/
├── main.tf
├── output.tf
├── project-ref.tf
├── provider.tf
├── variables.tf
└── README.md


✅ Pros

Simple and easy to maintain.

Good for smaller projects or POCs.

❌ Cons

Tight coupling between Cloud Run and LB.

No separation of IAM (service accounts) or networking (VPC).

Limited extensibility for enterprise needs.

Approach 2 – Extended Modular Stack

Modules:

Cloud Run stack

Load Balancer stack

Service Account stack

VPC stack

Flow:

Service Account → Cloud Run → Load Balancer  
           VPC ────────┘


Folder Structure:

appenabl/
├── modules/
│   ├── terraform-google-stack-cloud-run/
│   ├── terraform-google-stack-loadbalancer/
│   ├── terraform-google-stack-serviceaccount/
│   └── terraform-google-stack-vpc/
├── main.tf
├── output.tf
├── project-ref.tf
├── provider.tf
├── variables.tf
└── README.md


✅ Pros

Clear separation of concerns.

Scales well for enterprise setups.

Easier to enforce security and networking policies.

Reusable across multiple projects.

❌ Cons

Slightly more complex to manage.

Requires coordination between modules.

3. 📦 Recommended Design

We recommend Approach 2 (Extended Modular Stack) as the reusable pattern.
It provides a balance of modularity, scalability, and security, making it fit for production-grade environments.

4. 📂 Module Design

Each module should follow the structure:

module-name/
├── main.tf
├── variables.tf
├── outputs.tf
├── provider.tf  (optional if local provider config needed)
├── data.tf      (for lookups)
└── README.md

Example: Cloud Run Stack
module "cloud_run" {
  source     = "../modules/terraform-google-stack-cloud-run"
  name       = var.service_name
  region     = var.region
  image      = var.image
  vpc        = module.vpc.network
  service_sa = module.service_account.email
}

5. 🚀 Usage Pattern
Example main.tf for an environment:
module "service_account" {
  source     = "../modules/terraform-google-stack-serviceaccount"
  name       = "app-service-sa"
}

module "vpc" {
  source     = "../modules/terraform-google-stack-vpc"
  name       = "app-vpc"
  region     = var.region
}

module "cloud_run" {
  source     = "../modules/terraform-google-stack-cloud-run"
  name       = "app-service"
  image      = "us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/my-project/my-repo/app:latest"
  region     = var.region
  vpc        = module.vpc.network
  service_sa = module.service_account.email
}

module "load_balancer" {
  source     = "../modules/terraform-google-stack-loadbalancer"
  service    = module.cloud_run.url
  region     = var.region
}

6. 🧩 Reusability Guidelines

Keep inputs/outputs consistent across modules.

Always reference modules instead of hardcoding IDs.

Maintain a README.md in each module with usage examples.

Store common variables (project_id, region, labels) at the root level.

Use remote backend (e.g., GCS, S3) for state management.

7. ✅ Conclusion

For small-scale projects, Approach 1 is sufficient.

For enterprise / production, Approach 2 is strongly recommended.

This design ensures modularity, security, and scalability, while keeping Terraform stacks reusable across teams.




2. 🏗️ Approaches
Approach 1 – Minimal Stack

Description:
This approach focuses only on the application layer (Cloud Run) and the exposure layer (Load Balancer). It creates a Cloud Run service for hosting the application and exposes it via a global HTTPS Load Balancer. This is the simplest possible implementation, with minimal moving parts.

Use Case:

Proof-of-concepts (POCs)

Small internal applications

Environments where networking and IAM requirements are minimal

Modules Included:

Cloud Run stack – Deploys the containerized application.

Load Balancer stack – Creates an HTTPS load balancer pointing to the Cloud Run service.

Approach 2 – Extended Modular Stack

Description:
This approach introduces separation of concerns by modularizing key infrastructure components: Service Accounts (IAM), VPC (networking), Cloud Run (compute), and Load Balancer (exposure). It ensures that networking and IAM are explicitly managed, enabling security, scalability, and compliance.

The Cloud Run service is deployed with a dedicated service account and attached to a custom VPC. The Load Balancer is then configured to route requests to the Cloud Run service. This makes the stack suitable for production-grade applications.

Use Case:

Production workloads

Applications requiring private networking (VPC)

Environments with enterprise IAM policies

Teams needing reusability across multiple projects and environments

Modules Included:

Service Account stack – Creates and manages service accounts for Cloud Run with least-privilege IAM roles.

VPC stack – Provisions a private VPC, subnets, and firewall rules.

Cloud Run stack – Deploys application with correct networking and IAM bindings.

Load Balancer stack – Exposes Cloud Run service securely via HTTPS.
